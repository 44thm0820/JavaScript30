    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);  //Wes Wes
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2); //wesley Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux'; //updates both team and players
    //because we updated team, but team is not the array; team is just a reference to the original array, players.

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99; //person.age becomes 99 also

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);

    // Object.assign is ES6!
    // mdn definition: The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.
    /*
      JavaScript Demo: Object.assign()
      const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
      const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

      const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

      console.log(target);
      // expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

      console.log(returnedTarget);
      // expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
    */

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // now covered as January 2020!!
    // Spread in object literals covered in Chrome 60 according to mdn. Also Firefox 55 and Safari 11.1

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //we successfully now made a copy of the wes object, but shallow one level using Object.assign - further level down is not a copy but a reference - such that if you assign dev.social.twitter to '@coolman', wes.social.twitter becomes also '@coolman'

    //to do a real clone, use clone deep but also
    // you can use parse and stringify
